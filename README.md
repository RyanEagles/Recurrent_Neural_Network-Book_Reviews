# Recurrent_Neural_Network-Book_Reviews

RNN Book Reviews is a project that utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) for sentiment analysis of book reviews. It aims to predict whether a book review is positive or negative based on the text content. The project uses the Keras library with a sequential model architecture consisting of an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and dense output layer.

## Prerequisites

To run the RNN Book Reviews model, you need to have the following software installed:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the RNN Book Reviews model, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Download the `RNNBookReviews.ipynb` notebook from this repository.
3. Open the `RNNBookReviews.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new book reviews.
5. Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different hyperparameters, preprocessing techniques, or evaluation methods.
6. Feel free to use the provided helper functions and modify them to suit your specific requirements.

Make sure to have your book review data ready in a suitable format for the notebook to process. You can adapt the provided data loading and preprocessing functions to handle your own dataset.

Note: The notebook assumes that you have a dataset of book reviews in a text format. If you have a different type of dataset or want to perform a different type of sentiment analysis task, you may need to modify the notebook accordingly.
